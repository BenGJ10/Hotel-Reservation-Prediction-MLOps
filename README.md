# Hotel Reservation Prediction

Hotel reservation systems are a core part of the hospitality industry, where predicting whether a reservation will be honored (i.e., not canceled) is crucial for **revenue management, customer satisfaction, and fraud prevention**.  

This project is an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** that predicts hotel reservation outcomes using machine learning. It integrates **data engineering, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, CI/CD automation with Jenkins, and cloud deployment on GCP** to simulate a production-grade ML system.

## Problem Statement
Hotels face significant challenges due to last-minute cancellations and no-shows. This leads to:

- üí∏ **Revenue loss**

- üèöÔ∏è **Inventory mismanagement**

- üòû **Customer dissatisfaction**

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a reservation will be **honored or canceled**, enabling hotels to make informed decisions in advance.

##  Use Cases
1. **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious or fraudulent bookings that are likely to be canceled.
   
2. **Revenue Management**: Improve dynamic pricing strategies by predicting booking reliability.
   
3. **Inventory Optimization**  
   - Manage room availability and prevent overbooking/underbooking.
   
4. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Detect at-risk customers and provide incentives to reduce cancellations.
   
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Help hotels plan staff and resources based on reliable reservations.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Source: Hotel reservation datasets (structured CSV/Parquet).  

- Steps:  
  - Load raw data from Google Cloud Bucket.  
  - Store versioned datasets in `artifacts/data_ingestion/` for reproducibility.  

### 2. Data Processing

- Data cleaning: handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  

- Feature engineering:  
  - Date-based features such as lead time and stay duration.  
  - Categorical encoding for hotel type, customer type, and deposit type.  
  - Outlier detection and handling to improve model robustness.  

- Dataset splitting into training and testing sets.  

### 3. Model Training

- Algorithms used:  
  - **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method for handling structured data and reducing overfitting.  
  - **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework optimized for speed and efficiency, suitable for large datasets.  

- Hyperparameter tuning performed with **RandomizedSearchCV** for optimal performance.  

- Evaluation metrics tracked: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  

### 4. MLflow Tracking

- Log key parameters, metrics, artifacts (confusion matrix, feature importance), and models.  

- Register the best-performing model in the `MLflow Model Registry`.  

- Compare multiple experiment runs to select a production-ready model.  

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate final model performance on the test set.  

- Emphasis on business-critical metrics:  
  - False negatives (predicting honored but actually canceled ‚Üí major revenue risk).  
  - Balancing precision and recall to reduce both financial loss and customer dissatisfaction.
