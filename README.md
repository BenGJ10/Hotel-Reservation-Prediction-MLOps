# Hotel Reservation Prediction

Hotel reservation systems are a core part of the hospitality industry, where predicting whether a reservation will be honored (i.e., not canceled) is crucial for **revenue management, customer satisfaction, and fraud prevention**.  

This project is an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** that predicts hotel reservation outcomes using machine learning. It integrates **data engineering, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, CI/CD automation with Jenkins, and cloud deployment on GCP** to simulate a production-grade ML system.

## Problem Statement
Hotels face significant challenges due to last-minute cancellations and no-shows. This leads to:
- Revenue loss  
- Inventory mismanagement  
- Customer dissatisfaction  

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a reservation will be **honored or canceled**, enabling hotels to make informed decisions in advance.

##  Use Cases
1. **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious or fraudulent bookings that are likely to be canceled.
   
2. **Revenue Management**: Improve dynamic pricing strategies by predicting booking reliability.
   
3. **Inventory Optimization**  
   - Manage room availability and prevent overbooking/underbooking.
   
4. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Detect at-risk customers and provide incentives to reduce cancellations.
   
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Help hotels plan staff and resources based on reliable reservations.
